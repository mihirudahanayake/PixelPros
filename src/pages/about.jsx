      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>PixelPlate</strong>! We provide a smart and simple way for customers to place their food orders directly from inside the restaurant.

        Our digital ordering system helps you browse the menu, choose your favorite dishes, and send your order to the kitchenâ€”all without waiting for a waiter. It saves time and improves your dining experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our system, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>View all available dishes with pictures and prices</li>
        <li>Select and customize your meal</li>
        <li>Place your order directly from your table</li>
        <li>Call for assistance if needed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note: This system is only for use inside the restaurant. We do not offer online or home delivery services at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for using our ordering system. We hope it makes your dining experience easier and more enjoyable!
